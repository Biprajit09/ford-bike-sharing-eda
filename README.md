# 🚲 Ford Bike Sharing Exploratory Analysis

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Ford GoBike dataset to uncover key insights around trip duration, user behavior, and business optimization opportunities.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze trip duration patterns and uncover factors that drive longer or shorter rides using Ford’s bike-sharing system. The analysis helps provide strategic recommendations for improving user retention, resource allocation, and overall efficiency.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Average Trip Duration Analysis
- **Insight:** The average trip duration is around 14 minutes, with a right-skewed distribution due to a small number of extremely long trips.
- **Business Impact:** Helps in setting pricing thresholds (e.g., free ride time limits) and optimizing bike distribution based on typical usage patterns.

### 2️⃣ Impact of Month/Season
- **Insight:** Data only covers January, limiting seasonality analysis.
- **Business Impact:** Highlights the need for full-year data collection to enable more accurate forecasting and seasonal planning.

### 3️⃣ Impact of User Type (Subscriber vs Customer)
- **Insight:** Casual Customers take significantly longer and more varied trips than Subscribers.
- **Business Impact:** Suggests targeting Customers with incentives to convert them into long-term Subscribers to boost retention and revenue.
